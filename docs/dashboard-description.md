# Dashboard Project Description

## Introduction
The **Site Visit Monitoring Dashboard** is an advanced analytical tool designed to track, visualize, and manage field visits across multiple projects. The interactive dashboard offers real-time insights into site visit data, including planned, conducted, and canceled visits. It provides a structured and user-friendly approach to data visualization, ensuring that key stakeholders can make informed decisions efficiently.

## Project Overview
The dashboard was developed to consolidate data from various projects, enabling better monitoring and evaluation of field operations. The process involved collecting raw data, categorizing visit statuses, and integrating dynamic filters for detailed analysis.

### 1. Summary of Site Visits
This section provides an overview of total visits conducted, canceled, and planned—organized by month. Key metrics include:
- **Complete Visits**
- **Cancelled Visits**
- **Planned Visits**

These figures offer a snapshot of field activities and help assess overall project efficiency.

### 2. Monthly Monitoring by Location Type
A bar chart displays the number of site visits conducted each month, categorized by entity type such as:
- Energy
- Infrastructure
- Water Resources
- Maritime

This helps identify sector-specific trends and evaluate monitoring frequency.

### 3. Planned Monthly Monitoring by Project
This visualization tracks scheduled visits for various projects, helping teams prepare resources and allocate efforts efficiently. The timeline-based analysis ensures that future monitoring activities are well-organized.

### 4. Geographical Distribution of Visits
A color-coded map represents the density of site visits across provinces. Provinces are visually distinguished by:
- High
- Medium
- Low visit frequencies

This enables stakeholders to identify priority areas for monitoring.

### 5. Monthly Site Visits by Project (MMP Chart)
This section shows site visits per project over time. Each project has a unique color for easier comparison. It supports tracking project-specific performance and monitoring trends by month.

- A toggle button allows switching between **column** and **line** chart views.
- A slicer lets users filter visits by **project name** for focused analysis.

## Filtering System
To enhance usability and customization, the dashboard includes six professional slicers:

1. **Province** – Filters site visits by region  
2. **District** – Narrows data to specific districts  
3. **Project Name** – Selects a specific project  
4. **Planned Field Work** – Highlights upcoming visits  
5. **Visit Status** – Filters by visit type (completed, cancelled, planned)  
6. **Type of Reporting** – Filters by reporting type (e.g., Ad Hoc, Regular)

All slicers dynamically update the dashboard visuals, enabling intuitive data exploration.

## Conclusion
This Monitoring Dashboard is a powerful tool for tracking and analyzing field operations across projects. With dynamic filtering and interactive visualizations, it empowers efficient decision-making and strategic planning. The insights it provides significantly improve project oversight, resource allocation, and monitoring efficiency.
